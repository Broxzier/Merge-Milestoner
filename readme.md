# Merge-Milestoner
A GitHub action that automatically sets a configured milestone for pull requests once they get merged.

Right now this is mostly a test repository to try things out. The intention is that this gets used by [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2) to not accidentally forget to set the milestone for merged pull requests.

<!-- TODO: Add example on how to use this -->
